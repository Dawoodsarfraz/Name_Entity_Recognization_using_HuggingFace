In this project, I am building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using Hugging Face models. The goal is to identify and classify entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other relevant information from text. I am utilizing DistilBERT, a smaller and faster variant of BERT, for NER tasks. The project leverages Hugging Face's transformers library, where the model is initialized using the AutoTokenizer for tokenizing the input text. The pre-trained model, distilbert-base-cased, is fine-tuned for NER tasks to extract named entities from various sources of text efficiently
